I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT MUCH OF THE CODE HERE WAS NOT MADE BY ME! I UNDERSTAND THE CODE, BUT MOST OF MY ASSIGNMENTS IN THIS CLASS WERE TO FINISH THE CODE AND IMPLEMENT METHODS!
This repo contains all the assignments I did in my COMP-211 class. This class taught me about low-level programming and hardware. All of these assignments were programmed in C.
In the final project, I made my own terminal using low-level system functions like fork().
